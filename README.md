# Hot Box - 2019
This is the project code for the Hot Box, temperature controlled enclosure. This project was done for my Intro to Engineering Design undergrad course. This project was to design an enclosure that would maintain a setpoint temperature, and display temperature data to a display. I collaborated with Will Aracri on this project, though his work was all on the mechanical engineering side and is not represented in this repository. This repository holds PlatformIO project data for embedded software, and an Altium project where the PCB I designed for this project lies. The PlatformIO/Arduino code for this project uses temperature sensors and heating elements to control temperature using a PID controller. Temperature data is output on an LCD display over I2C, and also logged on an SD card. This code can be deployed to an [Adafruit Feather 32u4 Adalogger](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-32u4-adalogger), with a relay Feather Wing to supply current to the heating elements.
